  "objectives": [
    "Learn all 10 complex/compound vowels (diphthongs)",
    "Understand batchim - consonants at the end of syllables",
    "Master the CVC syllable structure (Consonant-Vowel-Consonant)",
    "Start reading real Korean words"
  ],
  "context": [
    "Great job learning the basic Hangul letters! Now it's time to complete your alphabet knowledge. In this lesson, you'll learn complex vowels (also called compound vowels or diphthongs) - these are combinations of basic vowels that create new sounds.",
    "Did you know? Complex vowels might look intimidating, but they're actually quite logical! Many are just combinations of basic vowels. For example, ㅘ is literally ㅗ + ㅏ combined (wah). Once you understand the pattern, they become much easier to remember.",
    "You'll also learn about batchim (받침), which means 'supporting base' - these are consonants that appear at the BOTTOM of a syllable block. For example, in 한 (han), the ㄴ is the batchim. Batchim changes how you pronounce the syllable and is crucial for reading real Korean words.",
    "By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to read actual Korean words like 물 (water), 밥 (rice), 집 (house), and 삶 (life). You'll know the complete Hangul alphabet and be ready to start building vocabulary!"

  "explanation": [
    "Complex Vowels Formation: Many complex vowels are combinations: ㅘ = ㅗ + ㅏ (wa), ㅝ = ㅜ + ㅓ (wo), ㅢ = ㅡ + ㅣ (ui). Understanding this pattern makes them easier to remember!",
    "Batchim Basics: Batchim (받침) are consonants at the bottom of syllable blocks. Structure: Initial consonant + Vowel + Final consonant (batchim). Example: 한 = ㅎ (h) + ㅏ (a) + ㄴ (n) = 'han'.",
    "CVC Syllable Pattern: With batchim, you get the CVC (Consonant-Vowel-Consonant) pattern. Examples: 밥 (bap), 집 (jip), 손 (son). This is very common in Korean!",
    "Seven Final Sounds Rule: Although many consonants can be batchim, they're only pronounced as one of 7 sounds: ㄱ, ㄴ, ㄷ, ㄹ, ㅁ, ㅂ, ㅇ (ng). For example, ㅅ, ㅈ, ㅊ, ㅌ at the end all sound like 'ㄷ' (t).",
    "Double Batchim: Some syllables have TWO consonants as batchim (like 닭 - chicken). But you typically only pronounce one of them. Don't worry about these yet - they're advanced!",
    "ㅐ vs ㅔ: In modern Korean, ㅐ (ae) and ㅔ (e) sound almost identical to most speakers, both like 'e' in 'bet'. Same with ㅒ (yae) and ㅖ (ye). The distinction is historical, so don't stress about it!",
    "Reading Practice Tip: Now that you know all Hangul letters, practice reading everything! Korean street signs, K-pop lyrics, Korean restaurant menus, product labels - even if you don't know what the words mean yet, practice sounding them out!",
    "Congratulations: You now know the complete Hangul alphabet! 24 letters total (14 consonants + 10 basic/complex vowels). This is a huge milestone - from now on, you'll be learning actual words and grammar, not just letters!"
