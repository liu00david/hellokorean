    "Learn 4 more Korean consonants",

    "You've learned your first 6 consonants! Now let's add 4 more common consonants.",
    "These include ㅇ which is special - it's silent at the start of syllables but pronounced 'ng' at the end.",

    {
      "word": "ㅅ",
      "english": "consonant 's'",

      "type": "consonant"

    }
  ],
  "explanation": [
    "ㅅ is pronounced like 's' in 'see'. At the end of syllables, it's still 's' or sometimes 't' sound.",
    "ㅇ is the most unique! At the start of a syllable, it's completely silent (아 = 'a'). At the end, it's the 'ng' sound (강 = 'gang').",
    "ㅈ sounds like 'j' in 'jump'. It's between an English 'j' and 'ch' sound.",
    "ㅎ is like 'h' in 'hello'. Simple and consistent!",
    "Try reading: 하나 (hana = one), 사과 (sagwa = apple), 자다 (jada = to sleep)",
    "Remember: ㅇ at the start is silent, ㅇ at the end is 'ng'!"
