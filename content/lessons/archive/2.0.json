  "explanation": [
    "얼마예요? (How Much?): Essential shopping phrase! 얼마 = how much. Add 예요 to make it polite. Always use this when asking prices. 이거 얼마예요? (How much is this?), 저거 얼마예요? (How much is that?).",
    "돼요? (Is it okay?): From 되다 (to become/work). Used to ask if something is possible or acceptable. 카드 돼요? (Is card okay?), 사진 돼요? (Is photo okay?), 여기 돼요? (Is here okay?). Very versatile!",
    "주세요 Requests: [Action] + 주세요 = please do [action] for me. Examples: 도와주세요 (please help), 말해 주세요 (please speak), 기다려 주세요 (please wait). The -아/어 주세요 pattern shows someone doing something FOR you.",
    "천천히 & 다시: 천천히 (slowly) + 말해 주세요 (please speak) = please speak slowly. 다시 (again) + 말해 주세요 = please speak again. Add 한 번 (one time) = 다시 한 번 = once more. Perfect for when you don't understand!",
    "Language Questions: [Language] + 하세요? = Do you speak [language]? Examples: 영어 하세요? (Do you speak English?), 한국어 하세요? (Do you speak Korean?), 중국어 하세요? (Do you speak Chinese?).",
    "잃어버리다 (To Lose): Verb for losing things. 잃어버렸어요 = I lost it (past tense). Examples: 지갑을 잃어버렸어요 (I lost my wallet), 핸드폰을 잃어버렸어요 (I lost my phone). Hope you never need this!",
    "찾다 vs 찾고 있다: 찾다 = to find/look for. 찾고 있어요 = I am looking for (present continuous). Use -고 있다 to show ongoing action. 화장실을 찾고 있어요 (I'm looking for the bathroom).",
    "Korean Won: Korean currency is 원 (won). Prices use Sino-Korean numbers: 천 원 (1,000 won), 만 원 (10,000 won). 만 (10,000) is an important unit! 1,000,000 won = 백만 원 or 100 만원.",
    "Cultural Tips: Koreans appreciate ANY attempt to speak Korean, even if you make mistakes! Always bow slightly when greeting or thanking. Use two hands when giving/receiving money or cards. In stores, items are often placed in trays rather than handed directly - it's polite custom, not impersonal!",
    "Emergency Phrases: 도와주세요 (help!), 119 (ambulance/fire), 112 (police). Korean emergency services are excellent! Most major cities have English-speaking operators. Stay calm and speak clearly."
