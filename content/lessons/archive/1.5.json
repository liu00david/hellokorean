  "explanation": [
    "주세요 (juseyo) is an essential phrase meaning 'please give me'. Use it to order: [item] + 주세요. For example: 커피 주세요 (coffee please).",
    "밥 (bap) literally means 'rice' but is also used to mean 'meal'. 밥 먹었어요? (Did you eat rice?) is a common greeting asking if someone has eaten.",
    "The particle 가/이 marks the subject of a sentence. Use 가 after vowels and 이 after consonants. 김치가 맛있어요 = 'Kimchi is delicious'.",
    "좋아하다 (joahada) means 'to like'. The object of what you like takes the 을/를 particle: 음식을 좋아해요 (I like food).",
    "잘 먹겠습니다 (before eating) and 잘 먹었습니다 (after eating) are polite expressions showing gratitude for the meal. Always use these!",
    "좀 (jom) means 'a little' or 'some' and softens requests. 물 좀 주세요 sounds more polite than just 물 주세요."
