    "Numbers are fundamental to daily communication, whether you're shopping, telling time, or talking about dates. However, Korean has a unique feature that can initially seem confusing: it uses TWO different number systems! Don't worry - with practice, you'll naturally know which one to use.",
    "Did you know? The dual number system in Korean reflects its historical Chinese influence (Sino-Korean numbers) while also preserving its native Korean roots (Native Korean numbers). This is similar to how English uses both Germanic and Latin-based words.",
    "Understanding when to use each number system is crucial. Think of Sino-Korean numbers as more 'formal' and used for official contexts like dates and money, while Native Korean numbers are used for everyday counting of objects and people. This lesson will help you master both systems!"

  "explanation": [
    "Korean has two number systems: Sino-Korean (Chinese-origin) and Native Korean numbers.",
    "Sino-Korean numbers (일, 이, 삼...) are used for: dates, months, money, phone numbers, addresses, and math.",
    "Native Korean numbers (하나, 둘, 셋...) are used for: counting objects, people, ages (up to 99), and hours.",
    "When counting objects with Native Korean numbers, the number changes slightly: 하나 becomes 한, 둘 becomes 두, 셋 becomes 세, 넷 becomes 네.",
    "Counters (like 개, 명) are essential in Korean - you can't just say 'three', you must say 'three [counter]'."
