  "explanation": [
    "Transportation Verbs: 타다 (to ride/take) is used for all transportation. 버스를 타다 (take the bus), 지하철을 타다 (take the subway), 택시를 타다 (take a taxi). 내리다 (to get off) is the opposite.",
    "Directional Words: 오른쪽 (right side), 왼쪽 (left side), 직진 (straight), 앞 (front), 뒤 (back). Add 으로/로 for direction: 오른쪽으로 (toward the right), 왼쪽으로 (toward the left).",
    "으로/로 Particle: Indicates direction or method. Use 으로 after consonants, 로 after vowels. Examples: 오른쪽으로 (to the right), 학교로 (toward school), 버스로 (by bus).",
    "Asking Where: 어디예요? (where is it?) or 어디에 있어요? (where is it located?). Examples: 화장실이 어디예요? (Where's the bathroom?), 지하철역이 어디에 있어요? (Where's the subway station?).",
    "Command Form -세요: To give directions politely, use verb stem + 세요. 가다 → 가세요 (please go), 오다 → 오세요 (please come), 타다 → 타세요 (please take/ride). Very useful for directions!",
    "가깝다 vs 멀다: 가깝다 = to be close/near (conjugates to 가까워요), 멀다 = to be far (conjugates to 멀어요). These are adjectives describing distance. Example: 학교가 가까워요 (school is close).",
    "걸어가다: Literally 'walk + go' = to go by walking. Korean often combines verbs like this. 걸어오다 = walk + come = to come by walking. 뛰어가다 = run + go = to go by running.",
    "Transportation Etiquette: In Korea, give up your seat for elderly people and pregnant women on public transport. It's considered very rude not to! The designated elderly seats are strictly reserved."
