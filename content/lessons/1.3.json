  "objectives": [
    "Learn how to introduce yourself in Korean",
    "Master the polite -이에요/예요 structure (to be)",
    "Understand topic and subject particles (는/은, 이/가)",
    "Practice asking basic questions about others"
  ],
  "context": [
    "Now that you can greet people, it's time to introduce yourself! Being able to say who you are, where you're from, and what you do is essential in any language. In Korean culture, proper self-introductions are crucial for building relationships, whether in formal business settings or casual social situations.",
    "Did you know? In Korea, it's common to introduce yourself with your full name, age, and occupation or school when meeting someone for the first time. Koreans also often add their hometown or where they live. The level of detail depends on the formality of the situation and the social context.",
    "This lesson introduces the polite 'to be' form: 이에요/예요. This is one of the most important sentence structures in Korean. You'll use it constantly to identify things, describe yourself, and talk about others. It's the foundation for making basic sentences!",
    "You'll also learn about particles - small markers that show the role of words in a sentence. Korean uses particles instead of word order to show meaning. The topic particle (는/은) and subject particle (이/가) are fundamental to Korean grammar."

  "explanation": [
    "저 (jeo) vs 나 (na): Both mean 'I/me'. Use 저 in polite situations (default for beginners). Use 나 only with close friends or people younger than you. When in doubt, always use 저!",
    "Topic Particle 는/은: Marks the topic of the sentence ('as for...'). Use 는 after vowels, 은 after consonants. 저는 = 'as for me'. 이름은 = 'as for the name'. Very common in Korean!",
    "이에요/예요 Structure: Means 'to be' (am, is, are). Use 이에요 after consonants, 예요 after vowels. Examples: 학생이에요 (student + 이에요), 의사예요 (doctor + 예요). This is one of the most essential Korean structures!",
    "저 + 는 = 저는: When saying 'I' as a topic, combine 저 + 는 → 저는 (jeoneun). This contraction is standard. Similarly, 저의 (my) → 제 (je). So 제 이름 = 'my name'.",
    "Nationality Pattern: To say nationality, use [Country] + 사람 (person). 미국 사람 = American, 한국 사람 = Korean, 일본 사람 = Japanese. Simple and logical!",
    "Question Words: 뭐 (what), 누구 (who), 어디 (where), 언제 (when), 왜 (why), 어떻게 (how). Add 예요 to make polite questions: 뭐예요? (what is it?), 누구예요? (who is it?).",
    "Dropping Subjects: Korean often drops subjects if they're obvious from context. 'I am a student' can be just 학생이에요 without 저는, if it's clear you're talking about yourself. This is very natural in Korean!",
    "만나서 반갑습니다: Literally means 'having met you, I'm happy'. It's the formal way to say 'nice to meet you'. The casual version is 만나서 반가워요. Use this when introducing yourself after stating your name!"
